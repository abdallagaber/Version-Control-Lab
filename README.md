# Version Control Lab

Welcome to the **Version Control Lab** – a practical learning project for mastering Git branching, merging, and collaborative development workflows.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a hands-on laboratory for understanding and practicing version control concepts using Git and GitHub. Team members work collaboratively by creating individual branches, making changes, and merging them back to the main codebase.

## Task Description

Each team member follows this workflow:

1. **Create a Branch**: Create a personal branch from the main branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

2. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes or additions to the project

3. **Commit Changes**: Commit your work with meaningful commit messages
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
   ```

4. **Push to Remote**: Push your branch to the remote repository
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**: Open a pull request to merge your branch into main

6. **Merge**: After review, merge your changes into the main branch
